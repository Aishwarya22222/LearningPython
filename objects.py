# Classes define the blueprint for objects, specifying the attributes (data) and methods (functions) 
# that the objects will have. From class we can create instance, an instance is a specific object created
# from the class.
 

# print(type(12.5))
# print(type([1,2,3,4,5]))

# To create a new object

class Student:
